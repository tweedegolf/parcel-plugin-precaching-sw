# Parcel plugin that creates a precaching serviceworker

The plugin is configurable by adding a `precachingSW` entry to your package.json file.

```json
  "precachingSW": {
    "bypass": false,
    "allowed": [
      "js",
      "css",
      "map",
      "html"
    ],
    "additional": [],
    "offlineUrl": "/offline.html",
    "fileName": "sw.js",
    "outDir": "./"
  },
```

- `bypass` &rarr; When set to `true` no serviceworker is created. Defaults to `false`.
- `allowed` &rarr; Array of file extensions that will be added to the cache. Defaults to an array containing the following extensions:
  - css
  - js
  - woff2
  - svg
  - ico
  - png
  - webmanifest
- `additional` &rarr; Array containing additional files that must be added to the cache.
- `offlineUrl` &rarr; Url of the offline html file, this file will be added to the cache as well. Defaults to `offline.html`.
- `fileName` &rarr; The name of the file that holds the generated serviceworker. Defaults to `sw.js`.
- `outDir` &rarr; The path to the directory where the serviceworker file will be saved to. Defaults to `./`.


## Example

In the example folder you'll find a very basic example of how to use and configure this plugin. To run the example `cd` into the example folder and run `npm i`. After all dependencies are installed run `npm run start`. Now parcels bundles the example app and after bundling it generates a serviceworker file. Then the app starts at localhost:1234.

In the package.json file you see that the plugin is added to the `devDependencies`. We are using `file:..` here so the local version of the plugin will be installed; this is handy if you want to tinker a bit with the plugin code. In your real-life project it will look something like `^0.0.2`.

Also in the package.json file you see the `precachingSW` entry; just play around with the parameters to get a grip on how they work.

The example project itself, and thus the project for which the plugin generates a precaching serviceworker is fairly simple: it contains an index.html that embeds a stylesheet (app.css) and a javascript file (app.js). In the stylesheet a background image is applied to the body; because the jpeg extension is in the `allowed` array, you can see in the generated serviceworker file that the background image gets cached as well.


## Building the example using a Node script

In some cases you need to create multiple bundles and these bundles may require different settings. Take a look at the `build.js` script inside the example folder. This script creates 2 bundlers by script:

```javascript
  const bundlerJs = new Parcel('app.js', config);
  const bundlerHtml = new Parcel('index.html', config);
```
The config object you see above is the Parcel bundler configuration object and additional entries get stripped off when the bundler bundles the files. So we need find another way to pass per-bundle configurations to the precaching plugin.

For this we use the `bundle.entryAsset.id`, this is the name of the file you pass as first argument to the Parcel constructor. So in our case we have the ids `app.js` and `index.html`.

By using this id as an extra entry to the `precachingSW` object every bundle can have its own configuration


```javascript
  "precachingSW": {

    // generic settings

    "bypass": false,
    "allowed": [
      "js",
      "css",
      "map",
      "jpeg",
      "html"
    ],
    "additional": [],
    "offlineUrl": "/offline.html",
    "fileName": "sw.js",
    "outDir": "./",

    // bundle specific settings

    "index.html": {
      "bypass": true
    },
    "app.js": {
      "fileName": "javascript-sw.js",
      "allowed": [
        "js",
        "map"
      ]
    }
  }
```
Please note that bundle specific settings will be merged with the generic settings. For instance the second bundle specific entry `app.js` uses the values set in the generic settings for `outDir`, `offlineUrl` and so on, but overrules both `fileName` and `allowed`. Thus the resulting settings of the `app.js` serviceworker will become:

```json
    "bypass": false,
    "allowed": [
      "js",
      "map"
    ],
    "additional": [],
    "offlineUrl": "/offline.html",
    "fileName": "javascript-sw.js",
    "outDir": "./",
```

## Use it in your project

Run:

`npm i -D parcel-plugin-precaching-sw`

or:

`yarn add -D parcel-plugin-precaching-sw`

Then optionally add settings to your package.json file.
